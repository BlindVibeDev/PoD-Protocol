# PoD-Protocol Development Rules

## Core Protocol Identity

**PoD-Protocol (Proof-of-Development Protocol)** is a decentralized verification framework for software development contributions. It enables transparent, immutable tracking of development work through cryptographic proofs and blockchain integration.

## Architecture Foundation

### Package Structure
- `@pod-protocol/core` - Protocol runtime, types, and fundamental abstractions
- `@pod-protocol/crypto` - Cryptographic primitives and signature schemes
- `@pod-protocol/blockchain` - Multi-chain integration layer
- `@pod-protocol/verification` - Proof verification and validation logic
- `@pod-protocol/contracts` - Smart contracts (Solidity/Vyper)
- `@pod-protocol/sdk` - Developer SDK for protocol integration

### Dependency Hierarchy
- Everything depends on `@pod-protocol/core`
- NO circular dependencies allowed
- Core package cannot depend on other packages

## Development Methodology

### 1. Protocol-First Design
**ALWAYS design the protocol specification before implementation**
- Research cryptographic requirements and security implications
- Map all proof generation and verification flows
- Document consensus mechanisms and network topology
- Create comprehensive threat model and security analysis
- Plan multi-chain deployment strategy

### 2. No Stubs Policy
**NEVER commit incomplete or placeholder code**
- Every function must be fully implemented
- No "TODO" comments in production code
- No proof-of-concepts - only production-ready implementations
- Complete test coverage required before merge

### 3. Cryptographic Integrity
**All code must be cryptographically sound**
- Use established cryptographic libraries (noble-curves, ethers)
- Implement proper key management and signature verification
- Validate all proofs through multiple verification paths
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Component Specifications

### Proofs
Development contribution verification mechanisms that transform code changes into cryptographic attestations:
- Generate cryptographic hash of development work
- Create developer signature using private key
- Store proof on blockchain with timestamp
- Enable verification by any network participant

### Validators
Supply validation logic for proof verification and consensus:
- Cross-reference commit data with blockchain records
- Validate cryptographic signatures and timestamps
- Implement reputation scoring algorithms
- Provide fraud detection and dispute resolution

### Verifiers
Post-verification processing for reputation and analytics:
- Extract knowledge from verified contributions
- Track developer reputation scores
- Generate contribution analytics
- Maintain decentralized identity systems

### Nodes
Manage decentralized network operations and consensus:
- Peer discovery and network topology maintenance
- Consensus mechanism implementation
- Data synchronization across network
- Network governance and protocol upgrades

## Security Requirements

### Cryptographic Standards
- **Signatures**: secp256k1, ed25519
- **Hashing**: SHA-256, Keccak-256, Blake3
- **Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure sources only
- **Multi-signature**: Support for organizational accounts
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving verification options

### Key Management
- Secure key generation and storage
- Hardware security module (HSM) support
- Key rotation and recovery mechanisms
- Multi-factor authentication for critical operations

## Testing Framework

### Test Categories
- **`pod test crypto`** - Cryptographic primitive validation
- **`pod test protocol`** - Protocol compliance and consensus testing
- **`pod test security`** - Security audit and vulnerability assessment
- **`pod test integration`** - Multi-chain and cross-platform testing
- **`pod test all`** - Comprehensive test suite execution

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 95% code coverage
- All cryptographic functions must have dedicated tests
- Adversarial testing for security-critical components
- Performance benchmarks for consensus mechanisms

## Blockchain Integration

### Multi-Chain Strategy
- **Primary**: Ethereum mainnet for high-value proofs
- **Secondary**: Polygon for cost-efficient operations
- **Layer 2**: Arbitrum for scalability
- **IPFS**: Distributed storage for large proof data

### Smart Contract Requirements
- Gas optimization for all contract operations
- Upgradeable contract architecture with governance
- Event logging for all state changes
- Emergency pause mechanisms for security incidents

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript/Rust Standards
- Strict type checking enabled
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Descriptive variable and function naming
- JSDoc/rustdoc documentation for all public APIs
- No `any` types in TypeScript code

### Documentation Requirements
- Protocol specification documentation
- API documentation with examples
- Security model documentation
- Deployment and configuration guides

## Governance and Compliance

### Protocol Governance
- Decentralized governance through token voting
- Proposal submission and review process
- Technical review committee for protocol changes
- Community feedback integration

### Regulatory Compliance
- Open source license compliance
- Data privacy protection (GDPR, CCPA)
- Financial regulations where applicable
- Audit trail maintenance for compliance reporting

This document serves as the foundational ruleset for all PoD-Protocol development work. All AI tools and developers must adhere to these principles to ensure protocol security, decentralization, and long-term sustainability.
