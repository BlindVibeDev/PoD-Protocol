# PoD-Protocol AI Configuration Setup Guide

## Quick Start

You now have comprehensive PoD-Protocol development configurations for all major AI coding tools.

## Setup Instructions by Tool

### 1. Windsurf IDE
**Copy to your PoD-Protocol project:**
- Copy `.windsurf/` directory to your project root
- Rules will automatically apply to Cascade AI interactions
- Use workflows with `/pod-development`, `/pod-testing`, etc.

### 2. Claude Code
**Copy to your PoD-Protocol project:**
- Copy `.claude/` directory to your project root
- Copy `CLAUDE.md` to your project root
- Commands available: `/protocol:dev`, `/protocol:test`, `/protocol:pod:action`, etc.

### 3. OpenAI Codex (Cloud & CLI)
**Cloud Version (ChatGPT):**
- Copy `codex/CODEX.md` to your project root
- Codex will automatically detect and apply rules

**CLI Version:**
- Follow instructions in `codex/config-setup.md`
- Configure ~/.codex/ directory with global instructions

### 4. GitHub Copilot
**Copy to your PoD-Protocol project:**
- Copy `github-copilot/.github/` to your project root
- Copy `github-copilot/.vscode/` to your project root (for VS Code users)
- Instructions automatically apply to all Copilot requests

### 5. Cursor IDE
**Choose one approach:**

**Legacy (Simpler):**
- Copy `cursor/.cursorrules` to your project root

**Modern (Recommended):**
- Copy `cursor/.cursor/` directory to your project root
- Provides context-aware rules

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Development** - Same PoD-Protocol patterns across all AI tools
✅ **Quality Enforcement** - Automatic validation of protocol principles
✅ **Security Compliance** - All tools understand cryptographic constraints
✅ **Complete Coverage** - From design to implementation to verification

## What's Included

- **Protocol-First Methodology** enforcement
- **No Stubs or Incomplete Code** validation
- **Cryptographic-Driven Development** with pod commands
- **Decentralized Architecture** standards
- **Security Specifications** (Proof-of-Development, Verification, etc.)
- **Protocol Abstractions** (Node→Network, Chain→State mappings)

## Next Steps

1. Choose which AI tools you want to use
2. Copy the appropriate configuration directories to your PoD-Protocol project
3. Start coding with AI assistance that understands decentralized protocols deeply!

All tools will now automatically apply the same development standards and security constraints, ensuring consistent, high-quality protocol code regardless of which AI tool you're using.
